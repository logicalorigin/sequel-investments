## What is a DSCR Loan?

A Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) loan is a type of mortgage specifically designed for real estate investors that qualifies borrowers based on the property's rental income rather than personal income. This makes DSCR loans an ideal financing solution for investors who may have complex tax situations, multiple properties, or self-employment income that's difficult to document through traditional means.

Unlike conventional mortgages that scrutinize your W-2s, tax returns, and employment history, DSCR loans focus on one key metric: can the property pay for itself?

## Understanding the DSCR Formula

The debt service coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the property's monthly rental income by its monthly debt obligations (PITIA - Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance, and Association dues).

**DSCR = Monthly Rental Income ÷ Monthly PITIA**

For example, if a property generates $2,500 in monthly rent and has monthly debt obligations of $2,000:
- DSCR = $2,500 ÷ $2,000 = 1.25

A DSCR of 1.25 means the property generates 25% more income than its debt obligations—a positive cash flow scenario.

### What is a Good DSCR?

| DSCR Range | Meaning | Loan Impact |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Below 1.0 | Negative cash flow | Higher rates, more scrutiny |
| 1.0 | Break-even | Minimum for many lenders |
| 1.0 - 1.25 | Positive cash flow | Standard terms |
| Above 1.25 | Strong cash flow | Best rates available |

At Secured Asset Funding, we have **no minimum DSCR requirement** and can close deals even when the ratio falls below 1.0—something most lenders won't do.

## Why Real Estate Investors Choose DSCR Loans

### 1. No Income Verification Required

The most significant advantage of DSCR loans is the elimination of traditional income documentation. You won't need to provide:
- Tax returns
- W-2 forms
- Pay stubs
- Employment verification

This streamlined approach means faster closings and less paperwork.

### 2. Borrow Through an LLC

Many experienced investors prefer to hold properties in LLCs for liability protection. Traditional mortgages typically require personal borrowing, but DSCR loans allow you to borrow through your business entity, keeping your personal assets protected.

### 3. Scale Your Portfolio Faster

Traditional lenders often limit borrowers to 4-10 mortgages. DSCR lenders evaluate each deal on its own merits, allowing you to scale your portfolio without hitting arbitrary lending caps.

### 4. Short-Term Rental Friendly

DSCR loans accommodate Airbnb, VRBO, and vacation rental properties. We can qualify STR income using projections from AirDNA or your own rental history.

### 5. BRRRR Strategy Compatible

The Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat strategy works seamlessly with DSCR loans. With no seasoning requirements at Secured Asset Funding, you can refinance immediately after completing your rehab.

## DSCR Loan Requirements

While DSCR loans are more flexible than conventional mortgages, there are still basic requirements:

### Credit Score
A minimum 660 FICO score is typically required. Higher scores generally result in better rates and terms.

### Down Payment
Expect to put down 20-25% for most DSCR loans. Higher down payments can offset lower credit scores or DSCR ratios.

### Property Types
DSCR loans work for:
- Single-family rentals (SFR)
- 2-4 unit properties
- Townhomes and condos
- Non-warrantable condos
- Short-term rentals
- Small multifamily (5-10 units with select programs)

### Documentation
While income verification isn't required, you'll still need:
- Signed lease agreement or market rent analysis
- Property insurance
- Bank statements for reserves
- Credit authorization

## DSCR Loan Terms at Secured Asset Funding

| Term | Details |
|------|---------|
| Rates | Starting at 5.75% |
| Loan Amounts | $100K - $3M |
| LTV (Purchase/Refi) | Up to 80% |
| LTV (Cash-Out) | Up to 75% |
| Term Options | 30-Year Fixed or 5/6 ARM |
| DSCR Requirement | No Minimum |
| Prepayment Penalty | Various options available |

## How to Qualify for a DSCR Loan

### Step 1: Identify Your Property
Find a rental property with strong income potential. Research market rents in the area using tools like Rentometer, Zillow Rent estimates, or local property management companies.

### Step 2: Calculate Your DSCR
Estimate your monthly rental income and divide by projected PITIA. Our [DSCR Calculator](/calculator) can help you run the numbers quickly.

### Step 3: Gather Documentation
Prepare your lease agreement (or market rent analysis for new acquisitions), bank statements showing reserves, and property insurance quotes.

### Step 4: Apply Online
Submit your application through our streamlined online process. You'll receive a preliminary term sheet within 24 hours.

### Step 5: Close Your Loan
Most DSCR loans close in 14-21 days. We can expedite to as fast as 10 days with complete documentation.

## Pros and Cons of DSCR Loans

### Advantages
- **Faster Closings** - No income verification means streamlined underwriting
- **LLC Borrowing** - Protect your personal assets
- **Scalability** - No limits on number of properties
- **Flexibility** - Works with various property types and rental strategies

## DSCR Loans vs. Conventional Mortgages

| Feature | DSCR Loan | Conventional Mortgage |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Income Verification | Property income only | Full personal income docs |
| Entity Borrowing | Yes (LLC, Corp) | Individual only |

### Can I use a DSCR loan for my first rental property?
Yes! DSCR loans are available to both new and experienced investors. First-time investors may face slightly higher rates or down payment requirements.

## What Is an Accessory Dwelling Unit?

An Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) is an additional housing unit built on a property that already has a primary residence. Sometimes called granny flats, in-law suites, or backyard cottages, ADUs typically range from 400 to 1,000 square feet and include all the amenities needed for independent living.

To qualify as a true ADU, a unit must have:
- A separate entrance from the main home
- Its own kitchen
- A bathroom
- Private living and sleeping spaces

## Types of ADUs

### Detached ADUs
Standalone structures completely separate from the main house. These offer the most privacy and often command the highest rents. Examples include converted garages (detached) or purpose-built backyard cottages.

### Attached ADUs
Units connected to the primary residence but with their own entrance. These might be additions built onto the back or side of an existing home.

### Internal ADUs
Conversions of existing space within the main home, such as:
- Basement apartments
- Attic conversions
- Converted attached garages

Each type has its own construction costs, permitting requirements, and potential returns.

## Why ADUs Are Growing in Popularity

The national share of homes with ADUs has grown from 1.6% in 2000 to nearly 7% today, according to Freddie Mac. Several factors are driving this growth:

### Housing Shortage
With housing demand outpacing supply in many markets, ADUs provide a way to add density without dramatically changing neighborhood character.

### Multigenerational Living
37% of homebuyers are millennials, many of whom have aging parents or adult children who may need housing. ADUs offer flexibility for changing family needs.

### Rental Income Opportunity
For investors, ADUs represent a way to nearly double rental income from a single property while maintaining a lower-risk single-parcel investment.

### Regulatory Changes
Many cities and states have relaxed ADU restrictions in recent years, making it easier than ever to add these units to existing properties.

## The Financial Benefits of ADUs

### Increased Property Value
According to a 2021 Porch.com study, homes with ADUs in major U.S. cities are priced **35% higher on average** than comparable homes without them. This premium reflects both the income potential and the flexibility ADUs provide.

### Additional Rental Income
An ADU can generate significant passive income:
- **Urban areas**: $1,500 - $3,000+ per month
- **Suburban markets**: $1,000 - $2,000 per month
- **Short-term rental markets**: Potentially higher with Airbnb/VRBO

### Better Financing Options
Properties with ADUs may qualify for higher loan amounts based on the additional income. DSCR loans, in particular, can factor in ADU rental income when calculating the debt service coverage ratio.

### Tax Benefits
ADU construction costs can often be depreciated, providing tax advantages for investors. Consult with a tax professional for specifics on your situation.

## Potential Challenges with ADUs

Before diving into ADU development, consider these challenges:

### Zoning and Permitting
Not all areas allow ADUs, and regulations vary significantly:
- Lot size requirements
- Setback rules
- Height restrictions
- Parking requirements
- Owner-occupancy rules

**Action Step**: Contact your local planning department before purchasing a property with ADU potential.

### Construction Costs
Building an ADU isn't cheap. Depending on the type and location:
- **Garage conversion**: $30,000 - $80,000
- **Attached ADU**: $50,000 - $150,000
- **Detached new construction**: $100,000 - $300,000+

Factor in permit fees, utility connections, and potential infrastructure upgrades.

### Property Tax Increases
Adding an ADU typically increases your property's assessed value, which may result in higher property taxes. Calculate this into your ROI projections.

### Management Complexity
Renting out an ADU means becoming a landlord (or hiring property management). Consider the time and effort involved in tenant screening, maintenance, and compliance.

## ADU Investment Strategies

### Fix and Flip with ADU Addition
Purchase a property with ADU potential, build the unit, and sell at a premium. The 35% average price increase for ADU properties can translate to significant profits.

### Buy and Hold Income Play
Add an ADU to a rental property to boost cash flow. The additional income can improve your DSCR ratio and help you qualify for better refinancing terms.

### House Hacking
Live in the main house while renting the ADU, or vice versa. This strategy can dramatically reduce your housing costs while building equity.

### Value-Add Development
Target properties with existing but outdated ADUs. Renovating these units can be more cost-effective than new construction while still capturing the income premium.

## Financing Your ADU Project

Several financing options exist for ADU development:

### Construction Loans
If you're building a new ADU, a construction loan provides funds as work progresses. These short-term loans can be converted to permanent financing upon completion.

### DSCR Refinance
If you own the property, you may be able to refinance and pull cash out to fund ADU construction. The projected ADU income can help you qualify for a higher loan amount.

### Home Equity Loans/HELOCs
For owner-occupied properties, home equity products can provide funds for ADU construction at relatively low rates.

### Fix and Flip Loans
If you're purchasing a property specifically to add an ADU and sell, a fix and flip loan can finance both the purchase and construction.

## Steps to Successful ADU Investment

### 1. Research Local Regulations
Before purchasing any property, thoroughly understand:
- Is the property zoned for ADU development?
- What types of ADUs are permitted?
- What are the size limits?
- Are there owner-occupancy requirements?
- What permits are required?

### 2. Analyze the Numbers
Create a detailed pro forma including:
- Construction costs (get multiple contractor bids)
- Permit and development fees
- Utility connection costs
- Projected rental income
- Timeline to completion
- Property tax increases

### 3. Secure Financing
Talk to your lender early in the process. Understand:
- What financing options are available?
- Can projected ADU income be used for qualification?
- What documentation will be required?

### 4. Work with Experienced Professionals
ADU development involves multiple stakeholders:
- Architects familiar with local ADU codes
- Contractors experienced in ADU construction
- Real estate attorneys for lease agreements
- Property managers for tenant placement

### 5. Plan for Management
Before your ADU is complete, develop a plan for:
- Marketing and tenant screening
- Lease terms and rent collection
- Maintenance and repairs
- Compliance with landlord-tenant laws

## Is an ADU Right for Your Portfolio?

ADUs aren't for every investor or every property. Consider:

**ADUs work well when:**
- Local regulations support ADU development
- The property has adequate space and infrastructure
- Market rents support the construction costs
- You have access to appropriate financing
- You're prepared for the added management complexity

**Consider alternatives when:**
- Zoning restrictions are prohibitive
- Construction costs exceed potential ROI
- The property layout doesn't support a quality ADU
- You prefer simpler investment strategies

## Strategic Renovation for Maximum ROI

As a real estate investor, every dollar you spend on renovations should work toward increasing your property's value and appeal. With rising labor and material costs, it's more important than ever to focus your budget on upgrades that deliver the highest returns.

The key is knowing which renovations buyers and renters actually care about—and which ones are just expensive distractions.

## The High-ROI Renovation Hierarchy

Not all renovations deliver equal returns. Here's how to prioritize your renovation dollars:

### Tier 1: Essential Improvements (First Priority)
These repairs are non-negotiable and affect the property's habitability:
- Roof repairs or replacement
- HVAC systems
- Plumbing issues
- Electrical problems
- Foundation concerns
- Water damage remediation

**Why they matter**: Buyers and inspectors will flag these issues. Unaddressed, they can kill deals or justify significant price reductions.

### Tier 2: High-Impact Cosmetic Updates
These improvements dramatically change perception without breaking the budget:
- Fresh paint throughout
- Flooring updates
- Kitchen refreshes
- Bathroom updates
- Curb appeal improvements

**Why they matter**: These create the "wow factor" that drives buyer interest and premium pricing.

### Tier 3: Nice-to-Haves
Consider these only after Tier 1 and 2 are complete:
- Smart home features
- Landscaping upgrades beyond basics
- Finished basements
- Deck additions
- Pool installations

## Kitchen Renovations: The Heart of the Home

Kitchens consistently rank as the most important room for buyers and renters. A mid-range kitchen remodel typically delivers a **72% ROI**.

### Budget-Smart Kitchen Updates

**Cabinet Refresh (vs. Replacement)**
New cabinets can cost $15,000-$30,000, but cabinet refacing with new doors and hardware costs 50% less while achieving a similar visual impact.

**Countertop Upgrades**
Quartz and granite remain popular choices. Budget approximately $50-$100 per square foot installed. Consider butcher block for a trendy, affordable alternative.

**Appliance Strategy**
- Stainless steel remains the standard
- Focus on the "big three": refrigerator, range, dishwasher
- Consider mid-range brands for rentals (LG, Samsung)
- High-end brands for luxury flips (Sub-Zero, Wolf)

**Backsplash Impact**
A new backsplash costs $800-$2,000 but makes a big visual impact. Subway tile offers classic appeal at budget prices.

### Kitchen Red Flags to Avoid
- Over-improving for the neighborhood
- Trendy finishes that may date quickly
- Luxury upgrades in entry-level properties
- Structural changes without clear ROI

## Bathroom Updates: The Second Priority

Bathrooms deliver approximately **60% ROI** on mid-range remodels. Focus on updates that maximize impact while controlling costs.

### High-Impact Bathroom Improvements

**Vanity Replacement**
Pre-fabricated vanity sets (cabinet, sink, countertop) cost $300-$1,000 and instantly update the space.

**Fixture Upgrades**
New faucets, showerheads, and hardware cost under $500 but signal quality throughout.

**Tub/Shower Refresh**
Before replacing, consider:
- Tub refinishing ($300-$600)
- Shower reglazing
- New glass shower doors

**Tile Considerations**
Full retiling is expensive. Consider:
- Cleaning and regrouting existing tile
- Accent tiles in key areas
- Vinyl plank flooring (waterproof, durable, affordable)

**Toilet Upgrades**
A new toilet costs $150-$400 and signals cleanliness. Choose water-efficient models for modern appeal.

## Flooring: Foundation of First Impressions

Flooring sets the tone for the entire property. Your choice depends on the investment strategy.

### Flooring Options by Strategy

**For Fix and Flip:**
- Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP): $3-$7/sq ft installed
- Engineered hardwood: $6-$12/sq ft installed
- Refinishing existing hardwood: $3-$8/sq ft

**For Buy and Hold Rentals:**
- LVP for durability and easy maintenance
- Commercial-grade carpet in bedrooms ($2-$4/sq ft)
- Tile for bathrooms and entryways

### Why Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP) Dominates

LVP has become the investor's flooring of choice because:
- Waterproof and scratch-resistant
- Easy DIY installation
- Realistic wood and stone looks
- Lower cost than hardwood
- Easy tenant maintenance and repairs

## Curb Appeal: The 7% Premium

First impressions matter. Studies show buyers pay up to **7% more** for homes with strong curb appeal. These updates often cost relatively little but make a big impact.

### Quick Curb Appeal Wins

**Front Door Focus**
- Fresh paint in a bold, complementary color
- New hardware (handle, knocker, house numbers)
- Consider a new door if current one is dated ($500-$2,000)

**Landscaping Basics**
- Fresh mulch ($200-$500)
- Trimmed bushes and trees
- Seasonal flowers or plants
- Clean, edged walkways

**Exterior Paint Touch-Ups**
- Trim and shutters
- Front porch
- Garage doors

**Lighting Updates**
- New porch light ($50-$200)
- Pathway lighting ($100-$300)
- Address numbers with lighting

## The Open Concept Question

Open floor plans remain popular, with **51% of homeowners** preferring open layouts. However, removing walls involves:

- Structural engineering assessment
- Permit costs and requirements
- Electrical and HVAC rerouting
- Flooring transitions

**When to open up:**
- Small, choppy layouts that feel cramped
- High-demand markets where buyers expect open concepts
- Properties where benefits clearly outweigh costs

**When to keep walls:**
- The layout already functions well
- Structural changes are cost-prohibitive
- The neighborhood demographic prefers defined spaces

## Budget Management Strategies

### The 70% Rule
For fix and flip projects, many investors follow the 70% rule:

**Maximum Purchase Price = (ARV × 0.70) - Renovation Costs**

This ensures room for profit after all costs.

### Contingency Planning
Always budget 10-20% above your renovation estimate for:
- Hidden issues discovered during work
- Material cost increases
- Timeline extensions
- Permit requirements

### Cost-Saving Tactics
- Get multiple contractor bids
- Buy materials during sales
- Consider prefabricated elements
- Focus on cosmetic over structural
- Do simple tasks yourself (painting, hardware)

## Renovation Mistakes to Avoid

### Over-Improvement
Don't create the most expensive house in a modest neighborhood. Research comparable sales and renovation levels.

### Trendy Over Timeless
Avoid overly specific design choices:
- Bold accent walls
- Ultra-modern fixtures
- Niche color palettes

Stick to neutral, timeless finishes that appeal to the broadest audience.

### Skipping Permits
Unpermitted work can:
- Kill deals during inspection
- Create liability issues
- Reduce property value
- Lead to costly corrections

### Ignoring the Neighborhood
Your renovation level should match neighborhood expectations:
- Entry-level area: Focus on clean and functional
- Mid-range: Quality finishes, updated appliances
- Luxury: Premium materials, smart home features

## Creating Your Renovation Plan

### Step 1: Property Assessment
Walk through with a contractor and note:
- Required repairs (Tier 1)
- Cosmetic update opportunities (Tier 2)
- Optional improvements (Tier 3)

### Step 2: Budget Development
Get detailed bids for each category. Include:
- Labor costs
- Material costs
- Permit fees
- Contingency (15-20%)

### Step 3: Timeline Creation
Sequence work efficiently:
1. Demolition and structural
2. Rough-in (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
3. Drywall and painting
4. Flooring
5. Fixtures and finishing
6. Final touches and cleaning

### Step 4: Contractor Selection
Evaluate contractors on:
- Experience with similar projects
- References and portfolio
- License and insurance
- Detailed bid breakdown
- Communication style

## What Is a Scope of Work?

A Scope of Work (SOW) is a detailed outline of all planned construction and renovations for your real estate investment project. Think of it as the blueprint for your entire rehab—documenting every task, material, cost, and timeline from start to finish.

For fix and flip investors, a comprehensive SOW isn't just helpful—it's essential. It's the document that:
- Guides your contractors
- Keeps your project on budget
- Satisfies your lender's requirements
- Protects you from scope creep and cost overruns

## Why Your SOW Matters

### Accurate ARV Estimation
Your After Repair Value (ARV) projection is only as good as your renovation plan. A detailed SOW helps you and your lender accurately estimate what the property will be worth post-rehab, ensuring your profit projections are realistic.

### Contractor Accountability
When contractors see a detailed, organized SOW, they take you seriously as a project manager. It sets clear expectations, reduces misunderstandings, and keeps everyone on the same page throughout the project.

### Lender Confidence
Private lenders and hard money lenders rely on your SOW to underwrite your loan. It demonstrates that you've thought through the project, understand the costs, and have a clear plan for execution.

### Draw Management
Most rehab loans fund construction costs through draws—installments released as work is completed. Your SOW forms the basis for these draws, defining what work must be completed before each payment is released.

### Budget Control
A well-crafted SOW helps prevent the dreaded "while we're at it" syndrome, where small additions snowball into major budget overruns. If it's not in the SOW, it requires a formal change order.

## Components of a Professional SOW

Your scope of work should include these key elements:

### 1. Project Overview

Start with the big picture:
- Property address and current condition
- Investment strategy (flip, BRRRR, rental)
- Target ARV and sale/rent timeline
- Overall renovation goals and quality level

**Example:**
*"This is a 3BR/2BA single-family home built in 1975. The property requires a full cosmetic renovation to achieve an ARV of $350,000. Target completion is 8 weeks with a flip exit strategy."*

### 2. Exterior Scope

Detail all exterior work, including:

**Roof**
- Repair vs. replace
- Material type
- Warranty requirements

**Siding/Paint**
- Areas to be addressed
- Paint colors and brands
- Repair vs. replacement

**Landscaping**
- Lawn restoration
- Tree/shrub work
- Hardscape repairs

**Other Exterior**
- Windows and doors
- Driveway/walkway
- Fencing
- Gutters

### 3. Interior Scope (Room by Room)

Break down each room with specific details:

**Kitchen**
| Item | Specification | Cost |
|------|---------------|------|
| Cabinets | Reface with shaker doors, white | $3,500 |
| Countertops | Quartz, gray veined, 40 sq ft | $2,800 |
| Backsplash | Subway tile, white, 20 sq ft | $600 |
| Appliances | SS package (fridge, range, DW, micro) | $2,400 |
| Sink/Faucet | SS undermount, brushed nickel faucet | $450 |
| Lighting | Recessed (6) + pendant over island | $800 |
| Flooring | LVP, gray oak, 150 sq ft | $1,200 |
| Paint | Walls and trim, Benjamin Moore White Dove | $400 |
| **Kitchen Total** | | **$12,150** |

Repeat this level of detail for:
- Each bathroom
- Living areas
- Bedrooms
- Garage
- Basement/attic (if applicable)

### 4. Systems and Infrastructure

Document major system work:

**Electrical**
- Panel upgrade requirements
- New circuits needed
- Fixture count
- GFI/AFCI requirements

**Plumbing**
- Water heater (repair/replace)
- Supply line work
- Drain line work
- Fixture installation

**HVAC**
- System age and condition
- Repair vs. replacement
- Ductwork needs
- Thermostat upgrade

### 5. Budget Summary

Compile costs by category:

| Category | Budget |
|----------|--------|

| 7 | Final Finishes | Hardware, lighting, touch-ups |
| 8 | Completion | Cleaning, staging, final walkthrough |

### 7. Contractor Information

List your team:
- General Contractor: Name, license #, contact
- Electrician: Name, license #, contact
- Plumber: Name, license #, contact
- HVAC: Name, license #, contact

### 8. Permit Requirements

Document required permits:
- Building permit
- Electrical permit
- Plumbing permit
- Mechanical permit
- Expected approval timeline

## SOW Best Practices

### Be Specific
Vague descriptions lead to disputes. Instead of "new kitchen faucet," write "Delta Fuse single-handle pull-down faucet, brushed nickel, model #9159-AR-DST."

### Include Material Specifications
Document:
- Brand names
- Model numbers
- Colors/finishes
- Grade/quality level

### Build in Contingency
Always include 15-20% contingency for unexpected issues. Older properties especially tend to reveal surprises once demolition begins.

### Document with Photos
Take photos of the current condition for each area. This creates a baseline for comparison and helps resolve any disputes about original conditions.

### Version Control
Date each version of your SOW. As changes occur, create updated versions rather than editing the original.

## Common SOW Mistakes

### Underestimating Costs
New investors often underestimate:
- Permit fees
- Dumpster rentals
- Utility costs during rehab
- Final cleaning/staging
- Holding costs

### Overlooking Hidden Issues
Budget for likely discoveries:
- Water damage behind walls
- Outdated electrical
- Plumbing issues
- Pest damage
- Foundation concerns

### Scope Creep
Once the project starts, it's tempting to add "just one more thing." Each addition should go through a formal change order process with cost and timeline impact documented.

### Timeline Optimism
Add buffer time to your schedule:
- Permit delays
- Weather issues
- Contractor availability
- Material backorders

## The SOW and Your Lender

### What Lenders Want to See

Private and hard money lenders evaluate your SOW for:
- **Feasibility**: Is the plan realistic for the property and budget?
- **Completeness**: Have you thought through all necessary work?
- **Cost Accuracy**: Do the numbers align with market rates?
- **ARV Support**: Will the planned work achieve the target value?
- **Experience**: Does the plan reflect investor competence?

### How SOW Affects Draws

Your SOW directly impacts how rehab funds are released:

1. **Initial Draw**: Some lenders release a portion upfront for materials
2. **Progress Draws**: Funds released as work phases complete
3. **Final Draw**: Remaining funds after completion and inspection

Each draw typically requires:
- Photo documentation of completed work
- Invoice/receipt backup
- Inspection (in-person or virtual)

### Change Orders

When the scope changes:
1. Document the change in writing
2. Get contractor pricing
3. Submit to lender for approval
4. Adjust timeline and budget accordingly

Unapproved changes may not be funded through draws.

## Digital SOW Management

Modern tools can streamline SOW creation and tracking:

### Spreadsheet Templates
Excel or Google Sheets work well for:
- Detailed line-item budgets
- Cost tracking
- Timeline visualization

### Project Management Software
Tools like Buildertrend, Procore, or Houzz Pro offer:
- Contractor collaboration
- Photo documentation
- Draw management
