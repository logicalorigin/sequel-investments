Thank you for contacting Easy Street Capital.



I'd like to introduce our Signature Broker Program, which enables brokers to white-label funds for both DSCR and Hard Money Loans for Fix & Flip, Ground-Up Construction, and Bridge + Cash-Out.



I've attached our Signature Broker Matrices for DSCR & RTL for your review, and an application for you to complete. Don't worry if the application is missing a few items, it's just for us to better understand your business.



Below are a few program highlights:

Monthly volume-based incentives - $3m or 10+ units = additional 25bps per loan; $5m or 15+ units = additional 35bps per loan

Strict Borrower Protection

Enhanced DSCR Pricing, Priority Processing, and Scenario Pricing Tool

100% White-Label Documents under generic entity (National Loan Funding, LLC)

DSCR Rates start at 6.125% (easy qualification / no DTI)

Hard Money Rates start at 8.99% / 1 Lender Point (no appraisal required / close in as little as 48 hours)

New & Upcoming:

 • 90% LTC now available for first-time flippers (previously capped at 80%)

 • New HCOLA base rate: 8.9% / 1.0 pts at 90% LTC / 75% ARLTV

 • Increased max loan size to $5M for CA and other high-cost markets

 • EasyBuild: Up to 90% LTC / 75% ARV with 3+ completed projects (now to $5M)

 • Refinance Program: Up to 75% LTV with reduced origination fees for existing ESC borrowers

 • No-Point Program: 12.9% / 0 pts

 • Expanded Geography: NY & NJ RTL programs

 • Broker-Branded Borrower Portals for DSCR & RTL servicing (launching soon)

 • RTL Pricing Tool (launching soon)

Depending on how your company is currently set up, this could be an opportunity to bolt-on both DSCR and Hard Money loan products to your existing product suite, with minimal work on the frontend and tons of benefits. There's no cost or commitment; our Signature Broker Program is just another correspondent channel for you to price deals through.



Looking forward to getting you onboarded and funding some deals.
